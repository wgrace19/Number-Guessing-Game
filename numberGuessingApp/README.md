README file for the guessing game web app from Module 2 in Microsoft's edx course: Building Interactive Prototypes with 
Javascript.
This program was written by Wyatt Grace Jan 2019.
The purpose of the program is to make a very simple web app to test basic fundamentals of using HTML and javascript togather.
The app has a hard coded in value wich the user has 5 attempts to guess. If the user repeats an input value the user is told so.
